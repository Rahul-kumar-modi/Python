## For Loop with lists

l = [1, "Rupesh", False, "This", "Rohan", "Shubham", "Mohan"]

# i = 0

# while(i<len(l)):
#     print(l[i])
#     i +=1

for i in range(len(l)):
    print(l[i])

for i in l:
    print(i)

## For loop with Tuples
t = (6, 231,45,21)
for i in t:
    print(i)

## For loop with Strings
s = "Rupesh"
for i in s:
    print(i)
